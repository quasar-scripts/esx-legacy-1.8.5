# esx-legacy-1.8.5
Copy of the official ESX Legacy repository converted to QS.
# Original repository 
https://github.com/esx-framework/
# Inventory purchase 
https://www.quasar-store.com/

# Instalation.
This package brings the important modifications to make it work with qs-inventory, but it will not bring the original package, you can buy it in the link that you will see above.
To install this package, we need to add qs-core, qs-inventory and qs-shops to it, and add the SQL, then drag and drop will work.

# Credits to ESX Legacy and its official repositories for providing this input to the fivem community.
This package is not official, since it brings modifications that alter the original functioning of es_extended, the only modification is applied in this folder and the others that you wish to do will be under your responsibility.
